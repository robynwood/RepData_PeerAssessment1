## ---Loading and preprocessing the data-------------------------------------------
# Show any code that is needed to
# 1.  Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

# set  working directory to where data and R program lives
setwd("/Users/Wood/Desktop/Data_Science/Reproducible Research/Course Project 1/")

# read in the activity.csv data to "activitydata"; yields 17,568 obs of 3 variables
activitydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# 2.  Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your 
#     analysis

str(activitydata)
#'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
# $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
# $ date    : chr  "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
# $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...

# need to change the date column from character to to a date format:
library(lubridate)
activitydata$date <- ymd(activitydata$date)

## ---What is mean total number of steps taken per day?----------------------------

# For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

# How many missing values?
sum(is.na(activitydata$steps))  
#     2,304
sum(is.na(activitydata$date))  
#     0
sum(is.na(activitydata$interval))  
#     0

# 1.  Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

totalsteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activitydata, sum)

# A table to show how many steps were taken on each day:
library(formattable)
formattable(totalsteps)

# 2.  If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, 
#     research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number 
#     of steps taken each day

hist(totalsteps$steps,
        main = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps per Day",
        xlab = "Total Steps per day",
        ylab = "Frequency")

# 3.  Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken 
#     per day

meansteps <- mean(totalsteps$steps)
#    10,766.19

mediansteps <- median(totalsteps$steps)
#    10,765

## ---What is the average daily activity pattern?----------------------------------

# 1.  Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") if the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
#    and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)



# 2.  Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, 
#    contains the maximum number of steps?



## ---Imputing missing values------------------------------------------------------

# Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values 
# (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some 
# calculations or summaries of the data.

# 1.  Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. 
#     the total number of rows with NAs)
# 2.  Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
#     The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use 
#     the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
# 3.  Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing
#     data filled in.
# 4.  Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate 
#     and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these
#     values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What 
#     is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily 
#     number of steps?

## ---Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?----

# For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset 
# with the filled-in missing values for this part.

# 1.  Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and
#     “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
# 2.  Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 
#     5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged 
#     across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in 
#     the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like 
#     using simulated data.
